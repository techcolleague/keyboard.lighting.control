Most modern laptops come with backlit keyboards designed to make typing in low-light conditions easier. Most keyboards have backlight illumination and glowing letters but, sometimes, this neat feature will refuse to work. If that’s the case with your laptop, the problem is usually not with the keyboard.

## How to Turn On the Keyboard Light On Windows Computers

Windows computers assign one of the function keys to control the keyboard light, but it isn’t the same key for every computer. Each manufacturer sets the key independently of the others. Hence, you have to look at the function keys, experiment with the function keys, or contact the manufacturer to determine which key to push.

The exact way the keyboard light key functions also differs from one manufacturer to another. Some manufacturers allow you only to turn the light on or off, some provide a couple of brightness levels, and others have multiple brightness steps.

Locate the button which controls the keyboard light.
Press the button, i.e. F5, F9, or F11.
Press the button again if you aren’t satisfied with the brightness.

## How to turn on a backlit keyboard?

If your HP notebook computer has a backlit keyboard, take a look at the top bar of your keyboard and locate the F5 button. This button may even be labeled with a backlight icon. Simply clicking this button while pressing the Fn button located at the bottom row of your keyboard will leave you with keyboard lighting operational magic.
It may be a simple on/off or, on some models, you can adjust the brightness of the backlighting.
Also, depending on your computer model, your PC may be configured to control the backlit keyboard via the F9 or F11 button rather than the F5 button. Practice the same simultaneous Fn + F11 operation to turn on a backlight keyboard light.
